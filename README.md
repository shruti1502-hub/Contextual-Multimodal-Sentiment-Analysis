# Contextual-Multimodal-Sentiment-Analysis
Emotion identification and sentiment analysis have become a new social media trend, eagerly assisting users in comprehending viewpoints expressed in social networks and user-generated content. With the progress of communication technology, the proliferation of smartphones, and the quick expansion of social media, web users are increasingly uploading vast volumes of material in the form of videos rather than words.In this project an attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network is proposed that not only models the contextual relationship between utterances, but also prioritises more relevant utterances for classification of the target phrase.This model shows 6-8% improvement over the
state of the art on a benchmark dataset.
